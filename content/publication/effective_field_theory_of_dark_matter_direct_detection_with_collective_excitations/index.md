abstract: "We develop a framework for computing light dark matter direct detection rates through single phonon and magnon excitations via general effective operators. Our work generalizes previous calculations focused on spin-independent interactions involving the total nucleon and electron numbers $N$ (the usual route to excite phonons) and spin-dependent interactions involving the total electron spin $S$ (the usual route to excite magnons), leading us to identify new responses involving the orbital angular momenta $L$, as well as spin-orbit couplings $L\\otimes S$ in the target. All four types of responses can excite phonons, while couplings to electron's $S$ and $L$ can also excite magnons. We apply the effective field theory approach to a set of well-motivated relativistic benchmark models, including (pseudo-)scalar mediated interactions, and models where dark matter interacts via a multipole moment, such as a dark electric dipole, magnetic dipole or anapole moment. We find that couplings to point-like degrees of freedom $N$ and $S$ often dominate dark matter detection rates, implying that exotic materials with orbital $L$ order or large spin-orbit couplings $L\\otimes S$ are not necessary to have strong reach to a broad class of DM models. We also highlight that phonon based crystal experiments in active R&D (such as SPICE) will probe light dark matter models well beyond those having a simple spin-independent interaction, including e.g. models with dipole and anapole interactions."
